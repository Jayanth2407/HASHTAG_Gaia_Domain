```

## ⚙️ 2. Install and Configure the Node (Copy and paste the full code)

```bash
home_dir="gaianet"
gaia_port="8000"
gaia_config="Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"
lsof -t -i:$gaia_port | xargs kill -9
rm -rf $HOME/$home_dir
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/uninstall.sh' | bash
mkdir $HOME/$home_dir
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash -s -- --ggmlcuda 12 --base $HOME/$home_dir
source /root/.bashrc
wget -O "$HOME/$home_dir/config.json" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jayanth2407/HASHTAG_Gaia_Domain/main/config.json
CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/$home_dir/config.json"
jq '.chat = "https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-Q5_K_M.gguf"' "$CONFIG_FILE" > tmp.json && mv tmp.json "$CONFIG_FILE"
jq '.chat_name = "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"' "$CONFIG_FILE" > tmp.json && mv tmp.json "$CONFIG_FILE"
grep '"chat":' $CONFIG_FILE
grep '"chat_name":' $CONFIG_FILE
gaianet config --base $HOME/$home_dir --port $gaia_port
gaianet init --base $HOME/$home_dir
```

---

## ▶️ 3. To Start the Node

```bash
gaianet start --base $HOME/gaianet
```

---

## 🆔 4. Get Node and Device Info

```bash
gaianet info --base $HOME/gaianet
```

---

## 🔴 5. To Stop the Node

```bash
gaianet stop --base $HOME/gaianet
```

## 🤖 6. Chatbot Script Setup (Mandatory to earn points) 

> **Key Points:**   
- Replace `"gaia-api1"` with your **actual API key(s)**. 
- Add as many api's you want, the chatbot will utilize all api's equally. DOnt add invalid/broken api's which is restricted/banned. 
- Use proxy if need or else leave it as it is. 

### Create/Edit the `chatbot.sh` Script

Paste the following script inside `chatbot.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# API keys
API_KEYS=(
    "gaia-api1"
    "gaia-api2"
    "gaia-api3"
)

# Proxies in http://username:password@ip:port format
PROXIES=(
    #"http://user1:pass1@ip1:port"
    #"http://user2:pass2@ip2:port"
    # Add more if needed
    # Leave as it is if you don't want to use proxies, if need remove '#'
)

# Gaia endpoint
API_URL="https://hashtag.gaia.domains/v1/chat/completions"

# Validated proxies - Dont modify anything here
VALID_PROXIES=()

# Validate proxies once at startup
validate_proxies() {
    echo "🔍 Validating proxies..."
    for proxy in "${PROXIES[@]}"; do
        if curl --silent --proxy "$proxy" --max-time 3 https://api.ipify.org > /dev/null; then
            VALID_PROXIES+=("$proxy")
            echo "✅ Proxy working: $proxy"
        else
            echo "❌ Proxy failed: $proxy"
        fi
    done
    echo "🔎 Valid proxies: ${#VALID_PROXIES[@]}"

### Make it Executable

```bash
chmod +x chatbot.sh
```

---

## 📟 7. Run Chatbot Script in Background (using `screen`)

### Install `screen` (if not installed)

```bash
apt install screen
```

### Create a New Screen Session

```bash
screen -S chatbot
```

### Start the Script

```bash
./chatbot.sh
```

### Stop the Script

Press `Ctrl + C`


### Detach from Session

Press `Ctrl + A`, then `D`

### Reconnect Anytime

```bash
screen -r chatbot
```
