# üöÄ Simple Guide to Run Gaia Nodes on Gaianet  
**Tested and verified for `hashtag.gaia.domains` domain only**

---

### üåê Domain: `hashtag.gaia.domains`  
### ü§ñ Model: `Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-Q5_K_M`

> **Minimum Requirements**  
- üß† RAM/VRAM: **10 GB**  
- ‚ö° Recommended GPU: **NVIDIA 3080 or above**  
- üîå GPU Power: **200W+**

---

## üîß 1. Install Required Packages and CUDA 12.8

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install pciutils lsof curl nvtop btop jq -y

wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
apt-get update
apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-12-8
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Install and Configure the Node

```bash
home_dir="gaianet"
gaia_port="8000"
gaia_config="Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"

# Kill any process on the same port and cleanup old setup
lsof -t -i:$gaia_port | xargs kill -9
rm -rf $HOME/$home_dir
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/uninstall.sh' | bash

# Create working directory and install node
mkdir $HOME/$home_dir
curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash -s -- --ggmlcuda 12 --base $HOME/$home_dir
source /root/.bashrc

# Download and set config
wget -O "$HOME/$home_dir/config.json" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jayanth2407/gaiaNode/main/config2.json
CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/$home_dir/config.json"

jq '.chat = "https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-Q5_K_M.gguf"' "$CONFIG_FILE" > tmp.json && mv tmp.json "$CONFIG_FILE"
jq '.chat_name = "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-Q5_K_M"' "$CONFIG_FILE" > tmp.json && mv tmp.json "$CONFIG_FILE"

# Verify config
grep '"chat":' $CONFIG_FILE
grep '"chat_name":' $CONFIG_FILE

# Final initialization
gaianet config --base $HOME/$home_dir --port $gaia_port
gaianet init --base $HOME/$home_dir
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 3. Start the Node

```bash
gaianet start --base $HOME/gaianet
```

---

## üÜî 4. Get Node and Device Info

```bash
gaianet info --base $HOME/gaianet
```

---

## ü§ñ 5. Chatbot Script Setup

> **Key Points:**  
- Each node can handle **max 10 requests per cycle**.  
- Replace `"gaia-api1"` with your **actual API key(s)**.  
- If using 1 API key ‚Üí `THREAD_COUNT=10`  
- If using 5 API keys ‚Üí `THREAD_COUNT=2` (5√ó2=10 total requests per cycle)

### Create/Edit the `chatbot.sh` Script

Paste the following script inside `chatbot.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# API keys (defined like general questions, one per line)
API_KEYS=(
    "gaia-api1"
    "gaia-api2"
    "gaia-api3"
)

# Single API URL
API_URL="https://hashtag.gaia.domains/v1/chat/completions"

# Thread count (can be changed as needed)
THREAD_COUNT=2

# Function to get a random general question
generate_random_general_question() {
    general_questions=(

```

---

## üìü 6. Run Chatbot Script in Background (using `screen`)

### Install `screen` (if not installed)

```

### Run the Script

```bash
./chatbot.sh
```

### Detach from Session

Press `Ctrl + A`, then `D`

### Reconnect Anytime

```bash
screen -r chatbot
```
